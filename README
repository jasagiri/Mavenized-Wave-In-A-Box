This is a set of maven projects using the wave in a box code reorganized in maven projects structure to build same targets as built by ant dist in WIAB codebase.

Tasks remaining -
1. Add the .st compilation task to proto-stringtemplate project
2. Add GXP compilation task wherever required.
3. Create the final wave-in-a-box project to put together all the jars.

Note there are currently some errors in the box project which should be solved once we have 1 & 2 accomplished.
